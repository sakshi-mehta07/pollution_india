# Projects

For your project, you need to form a team of 3 students (no other team sizes will be considered). You will *choose your own research question* and find appropriate datasets to answer your question. You will create a Python notebook that contains an exploratory data analysis of a chosen dataset. The notebook is expected to tell a story and the analysis should be clearly presented. You may choose one of the datasets from the list below, or from other sources. Your choice has to be approved by the lecturer.

Your notebook needs to demonstrate knowledge of applying the methods learned in the course, *covering both manipulating and visualising data*.

### Group member contribution
Group members must detail their individual contributions at the conclusion of the notebook. You are to quantify your contributions in the form of a percentage. The formula that will be used to calculate the final grade will be: grade = min(x, x * individual_contribution / 0.33) assuming a group of 3 members. As an example, if a project is marker 70% and the contributions are 40%, 35%, 25% then the grades will be min(70, 70 * 0.4 / 0.33) = 70, min(70, 70 * 0.35 / 0.33) = 70 and min(70, 70 * 0.25 / 0.33) = 53, accordingly. This is a formula that was used for other group project based work in the Department and is seen as promoting equal contribution to the project.

Should specific contributions not be documented, I will proceed under the assumption that all members contributed equally to the project.

Analysis of different datasets may require different amount of effort, which will be taken into account when grading submitted solutions.

## Important dates

* **Dataset choice approved by**: Friday, 13 December, 2024
* **Project submission date**: Wednesday, 22 January, 2025


## Criteria of evaluation

1. __Data manipulation__: use of different techniques for acquiring, cleaning, reshaping and querying data.  
2. __Data visualisation__: use of appropriate data visualisation methods for the underlying goals.
3. __Presentation__: overall organisation of the notebook, story telling, quality of presentation, use of both textual and graphical components, overall aesthetics and neatness, use of most efficient communication means, finding a good balance between using different methods and being concise and correct.

__Structure__ of notebook: The notebook must start by summarising the goals/research questions of the study and providing some background about the dataset and how this dataset can be used to address the asserted goals. It should then proceed through importing, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, followed by an exploratory data analysis using data visualisation and other means. The notebook may use different methods for managing and visualising data, but try to find a balance between being exhaustive and efficient in using those that best serve your underlying goals. The notebook may use different data analysis methods, from basic exploratory data analysis using statistical and other plots to those using special methods such as dimensionality reduction, graph visualisation, and other methods. Keep in mind that advanced modelling of data beyond the methodologies described in this course are not required or expected. The notebook must conclude with a section summarising the main findings of the analysis.
